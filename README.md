This repository contains a cycle-accurate SystemC Transaction-level Modeling (TLM) formalism (software) and a Vivado hardware implementation of a **sparsity-aware** spiking neural network (SNN). The network uses **leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons** and **event-driven computation**. The network parameters and input spikes are parsed from files generated by snnTorch. The model is capable of flexibly assigning hardware resources based on workload characteristics	of the neural net.

## Parameters

The software uses some global variables and constants defined in "defines.h". You can modify them according to your needs. Some of them are:

- INPUT_LAYER_SIZE: The number of neurons in the input layer.
- LAYER0_SIZE_LOGICAL: The number of neurons in the first hidden layer.
- LAYER1_SIZE_LOGICAL: The number of neurons in the second hidden layer.
- LAYER2_SIZE_LOGICAL: The number of neurons in the output layer.
- L0_NEURON_UNIT_SIZE: The neuron unit size in the first hidden layer.
- L1_NEURON_UNIT_SIZE: The neuron unit size in the second hidden layer.
- L2_NEURON_UNIT_SIZE: The neuron unit size in the output layer.
- TIME_STEP: The number of time steps for the spike train length.

## Usage
To run the SystemC software, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have SystemC installed on your system and set the `SYSTEMC` environment variable to point to its installation directory.
2. Run `./custom_run.sh` to execute the shell script that will generate neuron modules, parse data files, compile and run the SNN model.
3. Wait for the simulation to finish and check the output file `trace_log.txt` for the simulation time and output spikes.

Alternatively, you can run each step manually using the commands in `custom_run.sh`.
